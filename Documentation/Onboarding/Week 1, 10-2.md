- Make an account
- Extract downloaded zip & run exe
- Only download STLINK Drivers
	- STLINK USB driver is required to upload code to microcontroller board, make sure you have this  

#### Making a Project  
- Start New STM32 Project
	- It takes a bit because it has to download library files for the microprocessor
- Target Selection : STM32F439ZI
- Project Setup

	- Click Next
	- Check only "Copy only the necessary files"
	- Finish

#### Downloading Necessary Project Files
- Help -> STM32Cube updates -> Connection to myST
	- Then login to your ST account
- Open up the .ioc file in the project browser

- Generate Code

#### Code Generation
The IOC is a GUI abstraction that lets you easily configure all of the peripherals. What pins are on, what do they do, what kind of communication protocol to use, how long should a timer count, etc. When the IDE generates code, it takes all these settings and writes the C code that initializes and sets all these variables.

#### main.c
Open `main.c` The file is split into multiple sections by comments, each section has a specific purpose you should follow. In some cases, code generation will mess with certain sections, so make sure you are writing in the correct section to not get your code overwritten

`int main(void){}`   
	This function will be ran when the MCU first powers on.    

`while(1){}`   
	This is an infinite loop, it will run continuously. Embedded systems programming is unique because it uses infinite loops. This is fine because we want the MCU to repeatedly do something over and over. For example, we want to keep checking if we've received commands from topside. If we received a command, do something, then return to waiting.

### Task 1: Blinky 
Goal : Make the dev board's LED blink on and off
##### 1. Enable the LED pin
The dev board has an LED we can turn on and off. It is connected to the MCU via a pin. To find this pin, read through the dev board's user manual
